Verbose mode enabled.
Opened file BlakeTable_2Mx500.txt to export the rainbow table.
Table generation will be parallelized using 10 threads
Done parsing command line arguments.
How many chains per table?
2000000
How many links per chain? (# of reduction functions)
500 
Given m=2000000 chains/table, t=500 links/chain, l=1 tables and a keyspace of N=68719476736 
the calculated success probability is 0.014395 (1%)
